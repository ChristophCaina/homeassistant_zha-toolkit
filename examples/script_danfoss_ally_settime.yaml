description: >-
  A script that sets/updates the time on Danfoss TRVs.
  This is best called in an automation executed on a regular basis helping to
  ensure that the time on the TRVs stays correct.
  Could also be called when a TRV is detected to have been restarted,
  or it's synchronised value set to 0.
